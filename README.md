# Improving Impact Metrics

Enhancing Public Goods funding in the web3 ecosystem by establishing clear, vetted, impactful metrics for better decision-making and value creation within the Optimism community.

## Problem Statement

**Current Issue:** The poor allocation of Public Goods funding due to the lack of predetermined useful and verifiable metrics to measure the impact of Public Goods (OSS, Community, Education, Dev Experience, Governance contributions) in the web3 ecosystem.

## Target Audience

- **Badgeholders:** For the RetroPGF voting process.
- **Grants Council and other Councils:** To assist in funding decisions.
- **Projects:** RetroPGF recipients looking to fund new Optimism-aligned initiatives.
- **Builders:** In the Optimism ecosystem aiming to create valuable contributions and receive funding.

## Unique Approach

Our approach is distinctly different from existing market solutions by focusing on:

- Non-OSS projects and innovative metrics beyond traditional vanity metrics.
- Generating web3 adjacent data for non-code contributions rather than relying solely on existing extractable data.

## Role of Attestations

Attestations are central to our product:

1. **Standardization:** Providing a UI for projects to attest to their impact, standardizing data for evaluation.
2. **High-Context Data:** Leveraging modularity for accurate data analysis, reducing errors like misleading causality.
3. **Verification:** Allowing Impact Generators to produce verifiable, permissionless data for evaluation by Grant Operators and Public Goods funders.
4. **On-Chain Analysis:** Facilitating ecosystem-wide optimization of deployed funding once data is on-chain.

## Market Size

Our product targets three key audiences:

1. **Public Goods Funders:** Protocols, ecosystems, and communities with interest in standardized impact evaluation. (Over 5 ecosystems and 20 Grants programs expressed interest during EthDenver Grant Operator workshop).
2. **Impact Generators:** Projects, individuals, and protocols (Over 1K potential users in Optimism alone).
3. **Impact Evaluators:** Individuals, collectives, and high-context community members.
